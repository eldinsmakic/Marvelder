# Marvelder

Marvelder is an App that use Marvel API (https://developer.marvel.com/) to access six resource types:

- Comics: individual print and digital comic issues, collections and graphic novels. For example: Amazing Fantasy #15.
- Comic series: sequentially numbered (well, mostly sequentially numbered) groups comics with the same title. For example, Uncanny X-Men.
- Comic stories: indivisible, reusable components of comics. For example, the cover from Amazing Fantasy #15 or the origin of Spider-Man story from that comic.
- Comic events and crossovers: big, universe-altering storylines. For example, Infinity
- Creators: women, men and organizations who create comics. For example, Jack Kirby.
- Characters: the women, men, organizations, alien species, deities, animals, non-corporeal entities, trans-dimensional manifestations, abstract personifications, and green amorphous blobs which occupy the Marvel Universe (and various alternate universes, timelines and altered realities therein). For example, Spider-Man.

The idea is just to use an API provider and have fun learning more on SwiftUI + MVVM + Combine,
the app will have:

- A simple searching engine to find 
ressources from the six types

- Details on almost every ressources
